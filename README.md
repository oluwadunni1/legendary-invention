## Introduction

**Scenario**

As a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, I'm tasked with helping to increase annual memberships. Our marketing director believes this is crucial to the company's future success. To achieve this, we're analyzing the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. Based on these insights, we'll develop a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders. However, before implementing these changes, we must present compelling data-driven insights and visualizations to gain executive approval

**Business Task**

Identify differences in usage patterns between annual and casual ride members of Cyclistic, a bike-share company. This will inform the development of a market strategy aimed at converting casual members to annual members 
 
**Objectives** 

The primary objective of this analysis is to:
* Examine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
* Identify differences in ride behavior, such as frequency, duration, and time of use
* Provide actionable insights and recommendations for marketing strategies to convert casual members to annual members

**Data**

The analysis utilizes data from Cyclistic bike-share rides made available by Motivate International Inc. The data contains Cyclistics historical trip data organized quarterly from `January 2019` - `March 2020`. It includes :
* Rider Details: Duration, start and end times, and ride types
* User Information: Membership type(annual or casual)
* Additional data: Station IDs, day of the week, and ride frequency


## Analysis 

**Methodology**
The detailed methodology of this analysis can be found in [HTML report](https://oluwadunni1.github.io/legendary-invention/Cyclistic.html)

**Key Findings**
* Casual riders have a significantly longer average ride length every day of the week compared to annual members suggesting that casual riders tend to use the bikes for longer, more leisurely rides while annual members may use them for shorter, routine trips such as commuting
* Casual riders have a noticeable rise in ride length on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays suggesting they may be using the service more for weekend or leisure purposes.
* Annual members on the other hand have more consistent ride durations across all days further indicating commuting or short trips

**Recommendations**
Based on the above findings, the following strategies are recommended:
* The business could design marketing strategies around the weekend leisure riding behavior of casual riders. They could promote special offers for converting casual riders into members by highlighting the benefits of membership for weekend and leisure activities
* They could also introduce flexible membership plans such as a weekend only pass that provides a stepping stone toward a full annual membership for casual riders.
* Cyclistic can introduce member-only perks on peak days(Thursdays and Fridays) to allure casual riders to convert. These perks could be guaranteed early access to bikes on busy days or exclusive bike models for members
